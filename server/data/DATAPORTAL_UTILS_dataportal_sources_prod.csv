This source only includes the carbon footprint of CO<sub>2</sub>. Other greenhouse gases : CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, F-Gases are not taken into account here. CO<sub>2</sub> represents 74% of global greenhouse gases emissions, hence on average the carbon footprint of all greenhouse gases should be about 35% higher than the CO<sub>2</sub> carbon footprint.

# About

The CO<sub>2</sub> footprint of a country is the total amount of CO<sub>2</sub> produced directly and indirectly by this country. It's the sum of the territorial CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, plus the CO<sub>2</sub> embedded in imports minus the CO<sub>2</sub> embedded in exports.

kaya,"# About

The Kaya identity is an identity stating that the total emission level of carbon dioxide can be expressed as the product of four factors: population, GDP per capita, energy per GDP (energy intensity of GDP), and CO2 per energy (carbon intensity of energy).

In this dataset CO2 emissions are production-based.

# About 

Production-based emissions (as opposed to consumption-based emissions) are the emissions taking place within national territory, irrespective of whether the goods and services resulting from these emissions are consumed domestically or are exported. 

Consumption-based emissions take into account the effects of trade (See : [Carbon Footprint](https://theshiftdataportal.org/climate/carbon-footprint)).

## FAO
The ‘Emissions by sector’ domain of the FAOSTAT Agri-Environmental Indicators section contains data on emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) by gas, economic sector, country and year. The sources for these data are: • FAOSTAT emissions domains (Emissions - Agriculture and Emissions - Land Use) (FAO, 2016) for the sectors: ‘Agriculture total’, ‘Land Use sources’ and ‘Forest’. • EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research) (JRC/PBL, 2016) for the sectors: ‘Energy (energy industries, manufacturing and fugitive emissions)’, ‘Transport’, ‘Residential, commercial, institutional and AFF (Agriculture/Forestry/Fishing)’, ‘Industrial processes and product use’, ‘Waste’, ‘Other sources’ and ‘International Bunkers’. In the EDGAR database, developed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission and the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (JRC/PBL, 2016), the annual data on GHG emissions are available by country, source/sink category, gas and year. The source/sink categories follow the guidelines from IPCC (1997) Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories (Olivier et al., 2011, p.8). In this FAOSTAT ‘Emissions by sector’ domain, the source/sink categories from EDGAR have been aggregated into seven sectors, as shown in table 1 below. EDGAR data under IPCC categories 4 and 5 (‘Total Agriculture’ and ‘Total Land-Use Change and Forestry’) have not been included, as these data have been taken from FAOSTAT. EDGAR data for ‘International aviation’ and ‘International navigation/shipping’ are available only at the world level."

## Electricity generation capacity 

Electricity generation capacity is the maximum electric output an electricity generator can produce under specific conditions. Capacity is generally measured in GW or MW.

Electricity generation is the amount of electricity a generator produces during a specific period of time (1 year here). Electricity generation is generally measured in GWh or TWh.

## Primary Energy Production 

[Primary production of energy](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Primary_energy_production) is any extraction of energy products in a useable form from natural sources. This occurs either when natural sources are exploited (for example, in coal mines, crude oil fields, hydro power plants) or in the fabrication of biofuels.

Transforming energy from one form into another, such as electricity or heat generation in thermal power plants (where primary energy sources are burned), or coke production in coke ovens, is not primary production

## Primary Energy Consumption

[Primary energy consumption](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Primary_energy_consumption) measures the total energy demand of a country. It covers consumption of the energy sector itself, losses during transformation (for example, from oil or gas into electricity) and distribution of energy, and the final consumption by end users. It excludes energy carriers used for non-energy purposes (such as petroleum not used not for combustion but for producing plastics).

Final energy consumption is the total energy consumed by end users, such as households, industry and agriculture. It is the energy which reaches the final consumer's door and excludes that which is used by the energy sector itself.
